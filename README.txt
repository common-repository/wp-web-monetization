This plugin allows your Wordpress site to accept payments if the browser can inject payment.
== Description ==

This plugin allows Admin users to set a payment pointer where those with a Coil handler or browser extension (or native browser API) can send payments to the site.

Admins MUST set their payment pointer in the settings under 'Web Monetization Settings'. They can then choose whether or not to display a Coil widget to advertise web-monetization to non-Coil subscribers.
